    "Due to the limitations of the Newton-Schulz expansion, the error distribution can be minimized for an eigenvalue space. By default, we should force the space to within $[0,1]$ prior to eigensolving, and then recover the eigenvalues using the inverse operations. That's why one must define the translation factor $T$ and the scale factor $N$ appropriately.\n",

    "In this example, we obtain the absolute error distribution, mean absolute error and absolute error standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the smallest eigenvalue (ground state) after full compression of a population of random matrices at a fixed size. \n",
    "\n",
    "The routine is:\n",
    "1. The matrix of arbitrary eigenvalues is eigensolved to find its ground and top states, then it is normalized and translated to have its spectrum exactly within the domain $[T, N+T]$. \n",
    "2. Next, the transformed matrix is compressed using the choice of $\\texttt{block\\_eigensolver}$, and multiplied by its adjoint to restore Hermiticity. \n",
    "3. The new Hermitian matrix is eigensolved for the smallest eigenvalue, and this eigenvalue undergoes square root and all the inverse operations to recover the original eigenvalue. \n",
    "4. Finally, the error is computed between this recovered eigenvalue and the one obtained from eigensolving the original, uncompressed matrix.\n",

    "⚛️ Tetracene ($\\mathrm{C}_{18}\\mathrm{H}_{12}$, CID 7080) is a tetracyclic aromatic compound used in some OLEDs and transistors.\n",
    "In this example, we estimate its ground state using the SBD compression prior to eigensolving, for different compression rates. Next, we plot the error with regard to the uncompressed-LU eigensolver to visualize how the error decreases quite fast for the VQE, while the first few compressions show good agreement with the results of the uncompressed VQE.\n",

    "👶🏻 The Hamiltonian was generated using DFT with B3LYP functional and STO-3G basis set, considering a (6e, 6o) active space (6 active electrons and 6 active orbitals), for demonstration only, as more realistic models would be too heavy for a demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
